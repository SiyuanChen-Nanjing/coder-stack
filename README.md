# Channel Coder
Course Project of ECE559 in Spring 2020. 

A simplified version of 3GPP LTE channel coder in physical layer.

There are three sub-systems: 
- Code Block Segmentation and CRC (By Shiyu Li and Zhiyao Xie)
- Interleaver(By Yihao Huang, Brooke Keene and  Conor McAvoy)
- Turbo-code Encoder(By Matthew Barbano, Allen Cao and Siyuan Chen)


## Current Progress:
- __Full System__: Interface matched, tring to do functional simulation.
- __Code Block Segmentation and CRC__: Successfully run and verified on hardware. Woking on the Byte parallel version.
- __Interleaver__
- __Turbo-code Encoder__
